# startup-ecosystem-analysis

## Tasks

- 4/15 Project Proposal Due
- 4/28 First Milestone: You will describe your dataset, discuss a few interesting and important questions that you wish to answer using the dataset, present at least three different visualizations of the data, and discuss how these visualizations give insight into the questions you seek to answer. The report will be submitted as a pdf (max 4 pages) or html (of approximately equivalent length)
- 5/1 Peer Grading First Milestone
- 5/22 Final Report: You will use at least three data analysis methods learned in class to better answer the questions posed above about your dataset. The questions answered may be descriptive (what factors lead to high COVID-19 infection counts in US counties?), predictive (which countries will have more than 10 COVID-19 infections per 100K of population reported per week by September 2021?), or prescriptive (how should COVAX doses of COVID-19 vaccine be distributed in to minimize loss of life?). You may also propose a carefully-designed experiment to help go further in answering these questions. Data analysis tools that will be available for use in the class include linear regression, logistic regression, forecasting, factor models, optimization via random search, A/B testing, simulation, and stochastic models. (Forecasting, factor models, simulation, A/B testing, and stochastic models are covered in the second half of the course.) You may also use other tools to achieve your goal but they must be clearly explained. The report will be submitted as a pdf (max 8 pages) or html (of approximately equivalent length).
